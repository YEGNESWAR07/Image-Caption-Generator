# **Image Captioning with Deep Learning**

## **Overview**
The **Image Captioning System** is an advanced deep-learning model designed to generate meaningful textual descriptions for images. By leveraging the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequence generation, this project seamlessly integrates **computer vision** with **natural language processing** (NLP) to produce accurate and contextually rich captions.

## **Key Features**
✅ **Automated Image Captioning** – Generate descriptive captions for images with minimal manual effort.  
✅ **State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Models** – Uses **CNN** for feature extraction and **LSTM-based RNN** for sequence generation.  
✅ **Customizable Vocabulary** – Supports multiple datasets and can be fine-tuned for different applications.  
✅ **Scalable Training Pipeline** – Built with **PyTorch**, enabling efficient model training and evaluation.  
✅ **Pre-trained Model Support** – Fine-tune existing architectures for better performance.

## **How It Works**
1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Resize and normalize images using **ImageNet statistics**.
   - Extract visual features using **pre-trained CNN models** (ResNet, VGG, etc.).

2. **Caption Generation**
   - Sequence generation is performed using an **LSTM-based RNN decoder**.
   - The decoder predicts words step-by-step, constructing a coherent caption.

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained using **CrossEntropyLoss** and optimized with the **Adam optimizer**.
   - Large-scale datasets with varied vocabulary improve caption accuracy.

4. **Inference**
   - Generates captions for new images dynamically.
   - Caption generation stops upon reaching the **<EOS> token**.
